Erzählspiel
===========

Erzählspiel means "narrative game" or "storytelling game" in German.

This is a rules-light, universal tabletop roleplaying game that follows the ethos of the FKR (*Free Kriegsspiel Roleplaying*) of **"Play Worlds, not Rules"**.

This means that the focus should be put into making a believable (but not necessarily "realistic") setting and simulation of its internal rules instead of getting bogged down in specific mechanics and procedures. Players should interpret their characters as living persons inside this world and make decisions based on the context, their backgrounds and tools at hand. the Game Master should run the world sincerelly and impartially, as a neutral referee.

In order to play, you will either need a set of :hoverxref:`Narrative Dice <narrative-dice>`, or up to three six-sided dice (d6) if using the :hoverxref:`alternative dice rules <regular-dice>`. [#]_

.. [#] certain *Optional rules* or alternatives might require rolling other dice for certain situations. Also, in the **Worlds** sections, there are many random table generators that demand the use of other RPG dice like the d4, d8, d10, d12, d20, etc. It is recommended that (at least) the GM has a full set of polyhedral dice at hand.  

The GM will most likely peruse one of the Worlds and Scenarios provided in this site or document, as a guide to kickstart a gaming session (or multiple ones) of Erzählspiel.
