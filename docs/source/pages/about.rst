About this game
===============

Erzählspiel was born out of necessity to play roleplaying games in many different worlds or settings without having to read hundreds of pages of rules, or learn new mechanics and systems every time my group switched up from game to game.

There are many universal RPG systems out there, even rules-light ones, but eventually every GM wants to hack or create their own. Erzählspiel can serve as a starting point or as a demonstration of how to design a system from the ground up and then hack or tinker with extra rules on top of it.

This document is mainly a tool to be used by anyone who wants to quickly prepare and play an RPG session with the Principles of Erzählspiel in mind.
