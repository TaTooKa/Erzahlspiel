About this game
===============

Erzählspiel was born out of necessity to play roleplaying games in many different worlds or settings without having to read hundreds of pages of rules, or learn new mechanics and systems every time my group switched up from game to game.

There are many different flavors of Tabletop Roleplaying Games, with diverse rules systems and varying levels of complexity and "crunch", but for me the core characteristics of *"the Ur TTRPG"* are:
 
 - **Tactical Infinity**. A player can attempt whatever course of action they can imagine.   
 - **Roleplaying**. The players can put themselves in the shoes of a fictional character. 
 - **Simulation**. There is a light and basic system to simulate a fictional universe and its underlying rules. The GM can add complexity and nuance if so desired.

Erzählspiel attempts to fulfill these core precepts with as less excess as possible.
