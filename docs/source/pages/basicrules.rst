Basic Rules
===========

Players interpret Characters (AKA *Player-Characters*, or "PCs").

The *Game Master* ("GM") interprets the rest of the world and all *Non-Player-Characters* ("NPCs").

Action Resolution

The game is a conversation. Players take turns to describe what their characters do. Then the GM declares if the action...

- just **happens** as described and what's the outcome
- is **impossible**, or what extra steps would be required
- has a **cost**, that the character must pay or suffer in order to perform the action
- presents a **risk**, that the player must avoid before continuing (ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²)
- has an **uncertain** outcome, and a failure state is interesting (ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ²)


.. _rolling-the-dice:

Rolling the dice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If there is **risk** or **uncertainty** and the player decides to move forward [#]_, then they must **roll 2d6**, and:

.. [#] The player must be willing to take the risk before rolling the dice. They always have the option to back down and choose another course of action.

- add +1 if they have a relevant *skill*, 
- add +1 if they have a relevant *item*,
- add +1 if *helped* by circumstances or by someone else (but they share any risk or consequence)
- subtract -1 for each relevant :hoverxref:`hindrance <hindrances>` that affects the character

then check the total:

- a 6 or less is a **FAILURE**. Suffer full risk and/or don't get what they intended to do. 
- a 7 to 9 is a **PARTIAL SUCCESS**. They achieve the intended outcome but partially, and/or suffer a lesser version of the risk.
- a 10 or more is a **SUCCESS**. They get what they wanted, and avoid any risk.

A risk can be anything from a narrative consequence (something bad happens, the situation worsens, etc), a negative condition or a *hindrance* that the character receives, or in some dire situations, outright death. GMs must state clearly what the risk is before the dice are rolled.

Avoiding Risk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to avoid a risk is to try another course of action. If that's not possible and/or the player still wants to move forward with that action, then they would suffer the full Risk in case of a FAILURE, or a lesser version of it in case of a PARTIAL SUCCESS. Only a full SUCCESS would grant them total avoidance of the Risk.

.. _defense:

Defense
^^^^^^^

For risk of physical harm, characters can defend themselves by sacrificing an item they carry that could provide some sort of protection for the current situation [#]_. Said Item could be lost or completely destroyed, or just temporarily broken (it becomes useless until repaired by spending time and/or using proper tools). 

.. [#] Whatever the player decides to break, it must make sense in the fiction. You cannot stop a bullet with a screwdriver (...in most cases). Creativity is encouraged, but the GM has the final word on what makes sense and what is a stretch.

.. _hindrances:

Hindrances
----------

**Hindrances** are negative conditions that give a -1 each to any related roll (in actions in which the *hindrance* would adversely affect the character).

*Hindrances* are usually gained as a consequence of a bad roll (most likely after failing to avoid a danger or resist damage), but the GM can also impose a hindrance to a character automatically if the narrative demands so. A *hindrance* can be anything detrimental for the character that could affect them in future actions, like a physical injury, a negative condition like being over-encumbered or exhausted, a mental state like being over-stressed or terrified, a social state like being ashamed, distressed or humiliated, etc. 

3 or more *hindrances* usually mean that the character risks being **Taken Out** [#]_ in their next attempt (at GM discretion).

.. [#] If a character is **Taken Out** for long periods of time (or forever, if they died), their player should make a new character to introduce ASAP. Favor inclusion and fun over realism and rules. You might meet a new ally in the next room, promote a NPC to PC, or jump forward in time to recruiting a new teammate.

.. _taken-out:

Taken Out
~~~~~~~~~

Being **Taken Out** usually means losing the ability to stay in play with the agency to alter the world around them. This could be represented in different ways, depending on the context of the situation; exhausted, beffudled, K.O.d, or even dead.

Difficulty
----------

Since there is a set range of outcomes for any roll (6-; 7~9; 10+), in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of an action, the GM can impose a modifier of Â±X to a roll.

- If the character has some sort of **advantage** from an external circumstance, or the action would be particularily **easy** for an average person, they gain +1 to the roll.
- If the character has some sort of **disadvantage** from an external circumstance, or the action would be particularily **hard** for an average person, they recieve -1 to the roll.

These modifiers could increase to Â±2 if the GM deems so (specially if there are more than one circumstance affecting the action), but should keep in mind that a Â±2 would have a huge impact in a 2d6 roll [#]_. 

.. [#] In an unmodified 2d6 roll (+0), the most likely result is 7 (with a 16.67% chance). On 2d6+1, the most likely result moves up to 8. On 2d6+2 it's 9, and with 2d6+3 it's 10 (meaning it's likely to always succeed).

**Hindrances** already impose negative modifiers to character actions, which is another factor for the GM to consider when imposing difficulty penalties.
