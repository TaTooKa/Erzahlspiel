Characters
==========

In Erz√§hlspiel, characters are defined by their :hoverxref:`Descriptors <descriptors>` in natural language, which are short phrases that capture their key traits, skills, and backgrounds. 

The rules of this game don't care about 5% increments in skills, or high crunch in mechanics which deal with math and fine-tuning of game properties to min-max or do "builds". The focus is on narrative context and :hoverxref:`the GM's interpretation of the situation <interpret-the-odds>`, comparing what they know (or infer) from the fiction, the characters' traits and the particularities of the scene.

Although there is no hardcoded limit in how many Descriptors a character can have, a good rule of thumb is to begin with 3 to 6. Characters can "advance" by gaining new Descriptors, or by improving existing ones, but this is not a requirement of the game. To maintain some level of "balance", it is recommended that GMs have their players create characters with the same amount of Descriptors.

If using :hoverxref:`Descriptor Tiers <descriptor-tiers>`, consider giving each character at least one Descriptor with a higher tier (an ``Expert`` Skill, a ``Masterwork`` Item, etc).
