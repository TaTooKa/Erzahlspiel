Dying Sun
=========

*CENTURIES AGO, the world was a lush paradise of fantasy tales. But then came the ARCANE WARS, when the Archmages toppled kingdoms and their Defiling Sorcery desecrated the land into a broken wasteland. Now, even the Sun is dying.*

*Most folks struggle to adapt under the unwavering fist of the Sorcerer-Kings, rulers of the few remaining city-states. But not you: You are a wastelander, a survivor, and maybe even the only hope for those in need under the DYING SUN.*

DYING SUN is a World + Setting of post-apocalyptic survival fantasy, heavily influenced by **Dark Sun**, **Mad Max**, **Conan** and **Dune**.

New Rules
---------

These are rules pertaining specifically to games of Dying Sun.

**Load**: Characters can carry as much as makes sense, but more than two *bulky* items (or more than 3 *pieces of armor*) will make you *over-encumbered*: this is a **negative condition** (-1) for any roll that would be affected by it.

**Skill Mastery**: in Dying Sun, characters can be either *adept* (+1) at a *skill*, or a *master* (+2). Write down a +1 or +2 next to your skills to differentiate them.

**Item Durability**: Items in Dying Sun have different material qualities, and as an added **risk** to any roll, they could break on Failures or Partial Successes.

Gear
~~~~

Metal is too scarce in the deserts of the Dying Sun to be used as coin. Wastelanders use gems (◈) for currency. You begin with d6 ◈.

MATERIALS
^^^^^^^^^

An Item's material can be Low, Medium or High quality.

- Weapons and armor are usually made of **Low quality** readily-available materials like *Bone, Chitin, Stone, Leather, Furs,* etc. These tend to break easily on roll results of FAILURES or PARTIAL SUCCESSES.
- Items of **Medium quality** (*Strong Bone* or *Hide*, or even *Bronze*)only break on FAILURES, but cost twice ◈ to buy/repair.
- **High quality** material like *True Steel* only breaks if the player chooses so, but costs 5x◈ to buy/repair.

When generating random weapons/armor, first roll for **material quality** (2d6): 2-6: *Low*; 7-10: *Med*; 11-12: *High*.
