Dying Sun
=========

*CENTURIES AGO, the world was a lush paradise of fantasy tales. But then came the ARCANE WARS, when the Archmages toppled kingdoms and their Defiling Sorcery desecrated the land into a broken wasteland. Now, even the Sun is dying.*

*Most folks struggle to adapt under the unwavering fist of the Sorcerer-Kings, rulers of the few remaining city-states. But not you: You are a wastelander, a survivor, and maybe even the only hope for those in need under the DYING SUN.*

DYING SUN is a World + Setting of post-apocalyptic survival fantasy, heavily influenced by **Dark Sun**, **Mad Max**, **Conan** and **Dune**.

New Rules
---------

These are rules pertaining specifically to games of Dying Sun.

**Load**: Characters can carry as much as makes sense, but more than two *bulky* items (or more than 3 *pieces of armor*) will make you *over-encumbered*: this is a **negative condition** (-1) for any roll that would be affected by it.

**Skill Mastery**: in Dying Sun, characters can be either *adept* (+1) at a *skill*, or a *master* (+2). Write down a +1 or +2 next to your skills to differentiate them.

**Item Durability**: Items in Dying Sun have different material qualities, and as an added **risk** to any roll, they could break on Failures or Partial Successes.

Gear
----

Metal is too scarce in the deserts of the Dying Sun to be used as coin. Wastelanders use gems (◈) for currency. You begin with d6 ◈.

MATERIALS
~~~~~~~~~

An Item's material can be *Low*, *Medium* or *High* quality.

- Weapons and armor are usually made of **Low quality** readily-available materials like *Bone, Chitin, Stone, Leather, Furs,* etc. These tend to break easily on roll results of FAILURES or PARTIAL SUCCESSES.
- Items of **Medium quality** (*Strong Bone* or *Hide*, or even *Bronze*)only break on FAILURES, but cost twice ◈ to buy/repair.
- **High quality** material like *True Steel* only breaks if the player chooses so, but costs 5x◈ to buy/repair.

When generating random weapons/armor, first roll for **material quality** (2d6): 2-6: *Low*; 7-10: *Med*; 11-12: *High*.

.. tip:: Some materials can be gathered in the wild or by carving the corpse of felled beasts. Many wastelanders craft and repair their own gear in the field.

Magic
-----

Magic takes its energy from the life essence of everything around the caster. A magic-user knows how to tap just enough, to power their spells in a safe way.

.. _spells-section:

Spells
~~~~~~

.. compound::
   
   Spells must be tattooed on the caster's body and recited at the time of execution. To create a Spell, generate a formula with a d6: 1-2: **Effect + Element**, 3-4: **Element + Form**, 5-6: **Effect + Form**. Then define it with the following tables, extrapolating function from its name.
   
   Roll d6 twice to generate the **Effect**.

Spellcasting
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The effect of "safe" magic is usually subtle.

**DEFILING MAGIC** is the process to tap more than what's safe for greater power. Plants wither and die, soil goes infertile and dry, and creatures weaken and writhe. When you choose to do so, add +1 to your roll if you defile a few meters around you, or +2 if you desecrate a bigger area. The spell effect is stronger, but if you roll a **FAILURE** (6-) or you obtain a result **equal to or higher than 13**, you trigger a Magical Mishap.

Rituals
~~~~~~~

Some special or powerful effects cannot be cast instantly (or be encoded as spells), and require a more involved process, known as a **Ritual**. Magic Rituals can potentially achieve any desired effect the caster can imagine. 

The GM sets **1 to 4 conditions** before you roll:

- It's going to take hours/days/weeks/months
- You must perform it at a special place/time
- First you must do [X] or get help from [X]
- The effect will be unreliable or limited
- You and your allies will risk danger from [X]
- You'll have to sacrifice or consume [X] to do it
