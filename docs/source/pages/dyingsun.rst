Dying Sun
=========

*CENTURIES AGO, the world was a lush paradise of fantasy tales. But then came the ARCANE WARS, when the Archmages toppled kingdoms and their Defiling Sorcery desecrated the land into a broken wasteland. Now, even the Sun is dying.*

*Most folks struggle to adapt under the unwavering fist of the Sorcerer-Kings, rulers of the few remaining city-states. But not you: You are a wastelander, a survivor, and maybe even the only hope for those in need under the DYING SUN.*

DYING SUN is a World + Setting of post-apocalyptic survival fantasy, heavily influenced by **Dark Sun**, **Mad Max**, **Conan** and **Dune**.

New Rules
---------

These are rules pertaining specifically to games of Dying Sun.

**Hindrance**: a hindrance is a **negative condition** (-1), caused by many factors. for example, an encumbered character would be *hindered*.

**Load**: Characters can carry as much as makes sense, but more than two *bulky* items (or more than 3 *pieces of armor*) may *hinder* you at times.

**Skill Mastery**: in Dying Sun, characters can be either *adept* (+1) at a *skill*, or a *master* (+2). Write down a +1 or +2 next to your skills to differentiate them.
