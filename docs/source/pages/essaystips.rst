Essays & GM Tips
================

An assortment of thoughts, essays, procedures, recommendations and tips for the GM and/or players of Erzählspiel.

Simultaneous Initiative
----------------------
The usual in most TTRPGs (either on the rules-heavy/simulationist or in the more narrative side of the spectrum) is to have a single initiative order, where each player and the GM take turns in a round-robin fashion. Some GMs like to use an in-world initiative system, where the "reaction" or speed of the characters and the narrative context determines the order of actions. Others like to use cinematic or "popcorn" initiative; basically moving the spotlight as they see fit to make the scene as compelling and thrilling as they can.

But there's another option, taken from certain TTRPGs like Mothership: Simultaneous Initiative. GMs can use this method for all or for certain scenes in their games.

- The GM describes the scene and the situation, and what is likely to happen if there is no response or action from the players.
- The GM then goes around the table and asks each player to describe what their character would do in that situation, without rolling any dice (yet). Players can metagame as much as it is acceptable for the table, changing their desired course of action based on what other players say.
- Once everyone commits to their actions, the GM can then ask for rolls as normal, or resolve the actions narratively.
- After that, a new "round" begins; repeat the process from the beginning.

The important part is that all of the actions of a "round" happen simultaneously, although the description might go from participant to participant, focusing on their individual contributions. This changes the structure of play in significant ways:

- It changes the way of thinking from "individual/egoist" to "group/collaborative problem-solving".
- There is no "waiting for your turn" to act, so players are more engaged and involved in the scene.
- It allows for more dynamic and fluid storytelling, as players can react to each other's actions "in real-time", and helping each other / creating advantages between themselves.
- It's way faster than turn-based initiative.



Zoom and Speed level
----------------------
When running narrative RPGs, it is common to default to a "level of zoom" or "turn speed" inherited from other classic systems or rulesets. But nothing in Erzählspiel tells the GM to do so; One could increase or decrease those levels as much as they wanted as long as it still makes narrative sense and is fulfilling for their table.

This freedom in setting up whichever zoom/speed the GM desires, allows them to focus more or less on different situations as they see fit. A GM that wants to focus on the gritty details of combat might "reduce speed" to a slow-motion crawl, and ask for rolls at each and every step (position yourself, raise your weapon, find a weakspot on the opponent, attempt to hurt them, reposition for defense, etc). Other GMs might prefer to accelerate or handwave the process and have a single roll represent a whole exchange in combat. They can still describe with details before or after the action check, but the feeling and decision points make it a very different narrative outcome.

The same could be applied to Social Encounters. The usual in most TTRPGs is to resolve it with a single check, rolling the dice in a somewhat binary way; If there is success, the character has convinced or overcame their interlocutor. If they failed, the opposition has either not been convinced, or maybe convinced them of their argumentative point. But the GM could choose to zoom in and treat it more like a physical combat: Have each action deal a social Condition to the opponent. Most participants would yield and make a concession before being "Taken Out" in a social encounter, just like in real life.
