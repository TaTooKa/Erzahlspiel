Zoom and Speed level
----------------------
When running narrative RPGs, it is common to default to a "level of zoom" or "turn speed" inherited from other classic systems or rulesets. But nothing in Erzählspiel tells the GM to do so; One could increase or decrease those levels as much as they wanted as long as it still makes narrative sense and is fulfilling for their table.

This freedom in setting up whichever zoom/speed the GM desires, allows them to focus more or less on different situations as they see fit. A GM that wants to focus on the gritty details of combat might "reduce speed" to a slow-motion crawl, and ask for rolls at each and every step (position yourself, raise your weapon, find a weakspot on the opponent, attempt to hurt them, reposition for defense, etc). Other GMs might prefer to accelerate or handwave the process and have a single roll represent a whole exchange in combat. They can still describe with details before or after the action check, but the feeling and decision points make it a very different narrative outcome.

The same could be applied to Social Encounters. The usual in most TTRPGs is to resolve it with a single check, rolling the dice in a somewhat binary way; If there is success, the character has convinced or overcame their interlocutor. If they failed, the opposition has either not been convinced, or maybe convinced them of their argumentative point. But the GM could choose to zoom in and treat it more like a physical combat: Have each action deal a social Condition to the opponent. Most participants would yield and make a concession before being "Taken Out" in a social encounter, just like in real life.
