Colors of Magic
===============

Mana
---- 

Mana is everywhere, in different quantities or flow potencies. Mana is hidden from sight, but spellcasters and those attuned to the Arcane can feel it flowing through everything around them. Magic is like a spectrum of energies, and each Mana color is a representation of it. Mana of a color can be made to flow more or less intensely by altering the physical or emotional properties of a place. At the same time, an increase in the flow of a particular color of Mana in a location can permeate and affect the state of things and the feelings of individuals there. For example, a crowd that is bolstered to be angered or violent could increase the flow of Red Mana in that location, and a wizard channeling Red Mana could indirectly make the people of the place more prone to rage, spontaneity, impulsive actions, etc. In short, Mana is affected by, and affects everything in a location, reciprocally.

The GM can ascertain which colors of Mana are more or less abundant in a place or scene by thinking about the themes, mood, emotions and flavor of the situation and its inhabitants. If Mana of a specific color is scarce in the scene, Spellcasting characters might not be able to cast spells (or do so at a Disadvantage) at the GM’s discretion. Channeling Mana into a Spell exhausts it to a trickling amount, but as stated above, if the consequences or outcomes of the spell promote or bolster emotions or concepts related to that Mana Color’s domain, it might reflow and recycle itself throughout the area. Magic is not a zero-sum game; it is unpredictable.

Both players and GM should be familiarized with the core concepts and domains of each Color, to identify to which a spell or magical effect falls into. Mana colors can be combined as well, to achieve greater or more complex concepts and domains. Usually, colors combine with their “allies” or “adjacent” colors, to form consonant and agreeable composites. Although rare, colors can be combined between “enemies” or “opposites”, to generate effects that gather contrasting or otherwise paradoxical and conflicting concepts.

Spellcasting
------------

In general terms, a player describes what their character is attempting to do and what is the desired effect of their Spell (both with flavor and intent), and the GM determines which color(s) and power level correspond to the Spellcasting action. This determines the Odds of Success for the player to roll; then consult the Casting Magic: Results table for the outcome.

Spell Color
~~~~~~~~~~~

 The GM must determine the Color(s) of the Spell based on the player’s description of the desired magical effect. Players can debate and discuss at the table, but the GM has the final word.

Combined Colors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Spell might require 2 or more Colors of Mana, depending on its concepts (specially if the Spell is somewhat complex in its nature or desired outcome). When this happens, the Spellcaster needs to be skilled in each Color (see the skills section below), and either the lowest skill level is considered for the Spellcasting action, or an average of each skill must be used (at GM’s discretion, depending on the “weight” of each color in the spell).

Spellcasters and their Skills
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Characters who can cast magic are often called Spellcasters, Wizards, Mages, Sorcerers, Warlocks, etc. In terms of game mechanics, what defines a Spellcaster are the skills in each Color of Magic they have. The “skill levels” are Dabbler, Adept, Expert, Veteran, and Master.

The character must have at least a Dabbler skill level on a Color of Magic to even attempt to cast a Spell that has that color as one or more of its domains (in other words, a character who is not a dabbler in a specific color cannot cast spells that have that color as one of their requirements).

A character can have different skill levels on each Mana Color (in fact, most spellcasters prioritize learning one color; maybe two; at most three―4-color and 5-color wizards are extremely rare). Thus, a spellcaster character could have, for example, Blue Magic Expert, White Magic Adept, and Red Magic Dabbler.

The Skill Levels are for the GM to use as a guideline (or to compare between opposing spellcasters) when determining the Odds of Success for dice rolls.

During character creation, characters have 5 points to choose Magic skills. Dabbler costs 1, Adept costs 2, and Expert costs 3. Players can combine those points however they like to specialize or generalize as they wish.

Spell Power
~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three “power levels” to cast magic at: Subtle, Overt, or Massive.

Subtle magic creates effects that are discreet and often go unnoticed by others. It allows the caster to manipulate the environment or influence others without drawing attention. The effects are often small-scale, temporary, and weak.

Overt magic is more obvious and can be easily perceived by others. It often involves dramatic gestures, incantations, or visible effects that make the magic’s presence known. The effects are more powerful than subtle magic.

Massive magic is the most powerful and destructive form of magic. It can alter the environment on a grand scale, create catastrophic effects, or summon immense forces. This type of magic is often risky and can have unintended consequences.

Before Casting Magic, the player must decide if the spell is going to be Subtle, Overt or Massive. Sometimes the player just knows what effect they want to produce, and depending on their description, the GM can tell them if it is Subtle, Overt or Massive. Subtle magic sometimes doesn’t even require a roll (if the effect is minor enough or there is no great risk or consequence for failing). Massive magic, on the other hand, not only requires a roll but also requires a more involved process that the GM will determine at the moment (the GM sets 1 to 4 Conditions that the spellcaster must fulfill before they roll):

Massive Magic conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* It’s going to take hours/days/weeks/months 
* You must perform it at a special place/time
* You need to channel vast amounts of Mana of [X] color(s)
* First you must do [X] or get help from [X]
* The effect will be unreliable or limited
* You and your allies will risk danger from [X]
* You’ll have to sacrifice or consume [X] to do it
