In this magic system, players and GM imagine magical effects and cast spells in a narrative way. There might be "Arcane Schools", "Elements", or "Spell lists", but those would be fictional constraints that simply limit what a particular spellcaster can do as an arcane effect; the following rules apply to all.

There are three ways to cast magic: **Subtle**, **Overt**, or **Massive**.

**Subtle magic** creates effects that are discreet and often go unnoticed by others. It allows the caster to manipulate the environment or influence others without drawing attention. The effects are often small-scale, temporary, and weak.

**Overt magic** is more obvious and can be easily perceived by others. It often involves dramatic gestures, incantations, or visible effects that make the magic's presence known. The effects are more powerful than subtle magic.

**Massive magic** is the most powerful and destructive form of magic. It can alter the environment on a grand scale, create catastrophic effects, or summon immense forces. This type of magic is often risky and can have unintended consequences.

Before Casting Magic, the player must decide if they are going to be *Subtle*, *Overt* or *Massive*. Sometimes the player just knows what effect they want to produce, and depending on their description, the GM can tell them if it is Subtle, Overt or Massive. Subtle magic sometimes doesn't even require a roll (if the effect is minor enough or there is no great risk or consequence for failing). Massive magic, on the other hand, not only requires a roll but also requires a more involved process that the GM will determine at the moment (**the GM sets 1 to 4 Conditions** that the spellcaster must fulfill before they roll):

.. csv-table:: Massive Magic conditions

   "It's going to take hours/days/weeks/months"
   "You must perform it at a special place/time"
   "First you must do [X] or get help from [X]"
   "The effect will be unreliable or limited"
   "You and your allies will risk danger from [X]"
   "You'll have to sacrifice or consume [X] to do it"

Once the conditions and desired magical effects have been established, :hoverxref:`the GM will tell the player which die to roll <interpret-the-odds>`. Then consult the result depending on the type of magic below:

   "YES!", "the spell works as intended", "the spell works as intended", "the spell works as intended, but choose: you are ``Winded (Mild)`` or a **Minor Mishap** occurs"
   "YES! BUT...", "the spell works, but you are ``Winded (Mild)``", "the spell works, but choose: you are ``Winded (Mild)`` or a **Minor Mishap** occurs", "the spell works, but choose: you are ``Tired (Moderate)`` or a **Medium Mishap** occurs"
   "NO! BUT...", "the spell fails, but with no undesired effects or exhaustion", "the spell fails, but with no undesired effects or exhaustion", "the spell fails, and choose: you are ``Winded (Mild)`` or a **Minor Mishap** occurs"
   "NO!", "the spell fails", "the spell fails, but choose: you are ``Winded (Mild)`` or a **Minor Mishap** occurs", "the spell fails, but choose: you are ``Tired (Moderate)`` or a **Medium Mishap** occurs"
   "NO! AND...", "the spell fails, and choose: you are ``Winded (Mild)`` or a **Minor Mishap** occurs", "the spell fails, and choose: you are ``Tired (Moderate)`` or a **Medium Mishap** occurs", "the spell fails, and choose: you are ``Exhausted (Severe)`` or a **Major Mishap** occurs"

.. warning:: 

   Magic can be tiresome, the more powerful the arcane effect is. Some spellcasters absorb the magical discharge themselves (gaining a Condition that represents that exhaustion). Others release that energy into the environment, causing unpredictable **Magical Mishaps**. This is considered bad form and very negligent by the wizard community.
