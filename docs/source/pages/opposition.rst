Opposition 
----------

The Opposition are whatever **Adversaries** or **Obstacles** the PCs find in their adventures that impede their progress towards their objectives.

Think of them as puzzles to solve, not stat blocks to match against the player's dice rolls like in a boardgame.

In Erz√§hlspiel, the players should overcome the Opposition by making hard choices, being clever or thinking outside of the box. 

The GM should think and design the Opposition in terms of **Behaviors**, **Risks** and **Protections** [#]_.

.. [#] These concepts are taken almost verbatim from the mind of **Jason Tocci** (creator of the **2400** RPG). They're just too good to defile; they must be proselytized as is. See `this article <https://pretendo.games/2020/11/24/combat-in-24xx/#stat>`_ by him for his thoughts on the matter.

Behaviors
=========

*The objectives of the Opposition, which are at odds with the needs or desires of the PCs.*

If the Opposition is an adversary, **What do they do to get what they want?**

If it is an Obstacle, **What is its main function to impede the PCs or others?**

A wild creature might want to kill in order to feed; a robber might want to take your valuables, without necessarily having to murder you (in fact, they'd might want to avoid that if possible). A locked door's objective is to impede intruders to pass through. A pit trap in the floor is there so that intruders miss it and fall down (and probably get hurt enough to deter their progress).

Defining the **Behaviors** of the Opposition also determines how far they'd be willing to go, or which ones are their limits (or at which point they might consider surrendering or fleeing--might also trigger an :hoverxref:`Instinct Check <instinct-checks>`). In the case of Obstacles, knowing exactly why they are in that place and who put them there is key to understand their limitations and how they could be overcome.

Risks
=====

*The things that the Opposition does that threatens the PCs, or something they have or want.*

**What can the Opposition do that endangers the PCs in some way?** 

What happens when a PC that's accepting this risk rolls a FAILURE? And what happens in case of a PARTIAL SUCCESS? 

Adversaries or Obstacles that present physical harm could cause injury (in the form of :hoverxref:`Conditions <conditions>`) or even death. But they could also impart adversities of a different nature to a Character (being incapacitated, pinned, poisoned, blind, etc) or the environment (covering an exit, blocking passage, altering the terrain, provoking an ongoing hazard, endangering an object or NPC, etc).

By properly telegraphing the **Risks** presented by the Opposition, the GM gives the players all the information necessary for them to make interesting choices. If they find a way to get around of these risks by mitigating them or outright negating them, even better!

Protections
===========

*The things that the Opposition has that make it difficult for the PCs to hinder or overcome it.*

**What items, innate capabilities or tactics does the Opposition have to protect them from the PCs?**

What impedes the players to quickly end the encounter by just attempting to overcome it with a basic action and rolling the dice?

Adversaries or Obstacles should have at least one Protection (may be more) that must be overcome individually or by doing something specific. It could be some sort of armor or defense that must be disabled first. It could we a weak-point that must be targeted (in which the *fictional positioning* for that to happen could imply one or more action tests). 

It could be something that represents endurance or resistance, that must be wittled down ("their superior numbers must be reduced", or "We need to weaken it before giving the final blow!"). If this is the case, consider having whatever solution worked at first not be available any more for further attempts, lest you fall into the trap of "I attack!" "you dealt damage, now roll again!".

By designing interesting **Protections** for the Opposition, the GM can provide engaging puzzles for the players to overcome by thinking on their toes.


------------

Any or all of the **Behaviors**, **Risks** and **Protections** the Opposition has can be presented upfront, or be kept as secret information that the players...

- Have to investigate and identify previously, with proper preparation and legwork
- Discover gradually as they attempt things that don't work when confronting the Opposition
- Observe as the Opposition does their things and the GM telegraphs with or without subtlety
