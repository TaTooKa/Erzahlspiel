Optional Rules
==============

This is a collection of advanced rules and procedures that are by no means necessary to run a game of Erz√§hlspiel, but can be added as needed.

Fate Die 
--------

When the GM doesn't know something and instead of adjudicating for it arbitrarily wants to leave it to the fates, roll 1d6, in which a low result is bad for the PCs, and high is good.

For example:

- 1-2: trouble
- 3-4: signs of trouble
- 5-6: Everything's fine

Or use it to answer a YES/NO question, i.e.: Does the PC run out of ammo? 1-2: Yes; 3-4: No but there's only 1 or 2 bullets left; 5-6: Not yet, plenty to go.

or...

Do the guards notice the PCs? 1-2: Yes, they sound the alarm!; 3-4: No, but they are suspicious, moving to investigate; 5-6: Not at all, the PCs are safe for now.
