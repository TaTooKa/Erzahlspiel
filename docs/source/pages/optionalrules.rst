Optional Rules
==============

This is a collection of advanced rules and procedures that are by no means necessary to run a game of Erz√§hlspiel, but can be added as needed.

Fate Die 
--------

When the GM doesn't know something and instead of adjudicating for it arbitrarily wants to leave it to the fates, roll 1d6, in which a low result is bad for the PCs, and high is good.

For example:

- 1-2: trouble
- 3-4: signs of trouble
- 5-6: Everything's fine

Or use it to answer a YES/NO question, i.e.: Does the PC run out of ammo? 1-2: Yes; 3-4: No but there's only 1 or 2 bullets left; 5-6: Not yet, plenty to go.

or...

Do the guards notice the PCs? 1-2: Yes, they sound the alarm!; 3-4: No, but they are suspicious, moving to investigate; 5-6: Not at all, the PCs are safe for now.

Granular Bonuses
----------------

**Granular Bonuses** mean that instead of only gaining +1 for being Skilled and +1 for having a relevant Item, these could be +2 or +3.

Characters can either be *Skilled* at something (+1), or an *Expert* (+2), or even a *Master* (+3).

Items that Characters have can either be *Mundane* (+1), *Special* or *Masterwork* (+2), or even *Unique* or *Legendary* (+3).

The main issue (mechanically speaking) about this Option is that a +3 is already a big modifier in a 2d6 dice roll. If you combine both Skills and Items in this way, action rolls would become impossible to fail in most scenarios. It is recommended that you use this Optional Rule sparingly: Either Give +1/+2/+3 Bonuses to Skills but not Items (or viceversa), or only allow these bonuses up to +2, or allow any but always cap any roll at +3 max bonuses.
