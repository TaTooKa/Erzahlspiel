Optional Rules
==============

This is a collection of advanced rules and procedures that are by no means necessary to run a game of Erzählspiel, but can be added as needed.

Fate Die 
--------

When the GM doesn't know something and instead of adjudicating for it arbitrarily wants to leave it to the fates, roll 1d6, in which a low result is bad for the PCs, and high is good.

For example:

- 1-2: trouble
- 3-4: signs of trouble
- 5-6: Everything's fine

Or use it to answer a YES/NO question, i.e.: Does the PC run out of ammo? 1-2: Yes; 3-4: No but there's only 1 or 2 bullets left; 5-6: Not yet, plenty to go.

or...

Do the guards notice the PCs? 1-2: Yes, they sound the alarm!; 3-4: No, but they are suspicious, moving to investigate; 5-6: Not at all, the PCs are safe for now.

Granular Bonuses
----------------

**Granular Bonuses** mean that, when :hoverxref:`Rolling the dice <rolling-the-dice>`, instead of only gaining +1 for being Skilled and +1 for having a relevant Item, these could be bonuses of +2 or +3.

- Characters can either be *Skilled* at something (+1), or an *Expert* (+2), or even a *Master* (+3).
- Items that Characters have can either be *Mundane* (+1), *Special* or *Masterwork* (+2), or even *Unique* or *Legendary* (+3).

.. warning::

   The main issue (mechanically speaking) about this Option is that a +3 is already a big modifier in a 2d6 dice roll. If you combine both Skills and Items in this way, action rolls would become impossible to fail in most scenarios. It is recommended that you use this Optional Rule sparingly: Either...
   
   - Give +1/+2/+3 Bonuses to Skills but not Items (or viceversa), or 
   - Only allow these bonuses up to +2, or 
   - Allow any, but always cap any roll modifiers at +3 max.


Criticals
---------

Critical Successes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two options for Critical Successes (GMs can use either or both at their games):

- When rolling the dice, if the result is a **natural 12** (i.e. the two dice show a total of 12, regardless of any modifiers), this is a **Critical Success**.
- If the result (after applying modifiers) is **14 or more**, this is a **Critical Success**.

A Critical Success means that the Character not only achieves their intended outcome, but also does so in a spectacular way, or with some additional positive effect. The GM helps interpret the exact details and benefits.

Critical Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two options for Critical Failures (GMs can use either or both at their games):

- When rolling the dice, if the result is a **natural 2** (i.e. the two dice show a total of 2, regardless of any modifiers), this is a **Critical Failure**.
- If the result (after applying modifiers) is **2 or less**, this is a **Critical Failure**.

A Critical Failure means that the Character not only fails at their intended outcome, but also suffers some additional negative effect. The GM helps interpret the exact details and consequences.

Conditions
----------

*Conditions* are negative effects that characters receive (each gives -1 to related rolls in which the Condition might affect the outcome negatively). They can be *Mild*, *Moderate* or *Severe*, and a character can only have one of each type. If they receive a Condition of a type they already have, they gain a new one from a higher tier. If they can’t, they are **Taken Out**. Conditions take time and some sort of healing process to recover; the time and effort required depends on their severity (hours, days, weeks).

Applying Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Applying Conditions by attacking or somehow affecting an adversary, a **PARTIAL SUCCESS** causes a *Mild* Condition, a **SUCCESS** causes a *Moderate* one, and a **CRITICAL SUCCESS** causes a *Severe* one.

Resisting Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Resisting Conditions from a negative source, a **SUCCESS** avoids it entirely, a **PARTIAL SUCCESS** begets a *Mild* Condition, a **FAILURE** begets a *Moderate* one, and a **CRITICAL FAILURE** begets a *Severe* one.

Other Dice Systems

3d6
===

Instead of rolling 2d6, roll 3d6 and add the results for a total between 3 and 18 [#]_. Then:

- add +1 if *Skilled* at the action, +2 if *Expert*, +3 if *Master*.
- add +1 if *Item* is relevant, +2 if its *Special* or *Masterwork*, +3 if *Unique* or *Legendary*.
- add +1 if *helped* by circumstances, and +1 if *helped* by someone else (but they share any risk or consequence).

Then check the total:

- a 9 or less is a **FAILURE**. Suffer full risk and/or don't get what they intended to do.
- a 10 to 13 is a **PARTIAL SUCCESS**. They achieve the intended outcome but partially, and/or suffer a lesser version of the risk.
- a 14 or more is a **SUCCESS**. They get what they wanted, and avoid any risk.

.. tip:: If using Critical Successes, with 3d6 either a natural 18 or a total of 20+ is a Critical Success. For Critical Failures, a natural 3 or a total of 3 or less is a Critical Failure. The GM decides which option to use at their games.


The range probabilities are very similar to rolling 2d6:

+-----------------+--------+--------+
|                 |  2d6   |  3d6   |
+=================+========+========+
|     FAILURE     | 41,67% | 37,49% |
+-----------------+--------+--------+
| PARTIAL SUCCESS | 41,67% | 46,29% |
+-----------------+--------+--------+
|     SUCCESS     | 16,67% | 16,21% |
+-----------------+--------+--------+

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] This is a more "bell curve" style of rolling, where the average result is 10.5, and the extremes (3 and 18) are very unlikely to happen. With more granular results you can apply more nuanced modifiers, just like in the Granular Bonuses section above.
