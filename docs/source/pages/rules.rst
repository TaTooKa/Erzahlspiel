Rules
=====

Players interpret Characters (AKA *Player-Characters*, or "PCs").

The *Game Master* ("GM") interprets the rest of the world and all *Non-Player-Characters* ("NPCs").

The game is a conversation. Players take turns to describe what their characters do. Then the GM declares if the action...

- just happens as described and what's the outcome
- is impossible, or what extra steps would be required
- has a cost, or presents a risk, that the player must accept before continuing

If there is a cost or risk and the player accepts it, then they must **roll 2d6**, and:

- add +1 if they have a relevant *skill*, 
- add +1 if they have a relevant *item*,
- add +1 if if someone's helping them (but they share any risk or consequence)

then check the total:

- a 6 or less is a **FAILURE**. 
- a 7 to 9 is a **PARTIAL SUCCESS**.
- a 10 or more is a **SUCCESS**.
