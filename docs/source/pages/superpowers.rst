Powers
~~~~~~

Powers work like :hoverxref:`Granular Skills <expanded-granular-bonuses>`, acting as modifiers that go from +1 to +5. But Powers, first and foremost, give *narrative permission*. The higher the power level, the stronger or more capable the power is.

**Power levels**: Basic (+1), Good (+2), Incredible (+3), Fantastic (+4), Supreme (+5).
