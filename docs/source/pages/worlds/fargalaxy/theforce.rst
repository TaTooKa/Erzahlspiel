The Force
=========

FORCE USE
---------

Any character that has the *Force Use* skill is considered a Force User, and has access to creating different improvised or practiced effects with the Force.

- **E.S.P.** (gain new senses, like feeling invisible energies, emotions, danger, etc), 
- **Telepathy** (read or talk with other minds, trick lesser intellects, etc), 
- **Telekinesis** (move or physically affect objects from afar),
- **[Pre/Post]cognition** (glimpse moments of the future/past), 
- **[element]kinesis** (control over pyro/hydro/gravity/energies/etc).
- **OTHER** exotic effects (healing, illusions, metamorphosis, witchcraft, etc ―at GM’s discretion).

The GM determines if the desired effect (as described by the player) is **Subtle**, **Overt**, **Massive** or **Incredible**.

- **Subtle uses** (making a faraway sound; touching a button remotely; doing a mind trick) just work (no roll required) or have Advantage for the Force User’s roll
- **Overt uses** (pushing someone; moving something with finesse; Throwing an ignited lightsaber and returning it to one’s hand) usually require a regular roll
- **Massive uses** (pulling an x-wing out of the water; lifting an entire squad of stormtroopers; stopping a laser beam in mid air; reading people's minds) will probably give *Disadvantage* to the Force User’s roll
- **Incredible uses** (stopping a huge spaceship at long range; projecting your mind to distant planets; finding someone anywhere in the galaxy) are usually impossible without external factors like channeling a Force Nexus or getting help from greater artifacts or beings.

The GM must consider the above and the Force User’s level of expertise in the *Force Use* skill to determine their :hoverxref:`odds of success <interpret-the-odds>`. Then the player must roll the dice:

   * - 6
     - YES! AND…
     - You achieve what you were trying to cause, and with an added benefit, or with increased effect.

   * - 5
     - YES!
     - You achieve whatever special effect you were trying to cause.

   * - 4
     - YES! BUT…
     - You achieve whatever special effect you were trying to cause, but as a much lesser version of it, OR if you so choose, you can do it by willingly tapping the Dark Side (*The Dark Side Tempts You*).

   * - 3
     - NO! BUT…
     - You don’t achieve what you were trying to do YET, but you almost got it: You could try again (or continue with the effort) with a slightly better Advantage, OR if you so choose, you can do it by willingly tapping the Dark Side (*The Dark Side Tempts You*).

   * - 2
     - NO!
     - You don’t achieve what you were trying to do.

   * - 1
     - NO! AND…
     - You don’t achieve what you were trying to do, and you get a vision or malady related to the Dark Side (*The Dark Side Tempts You*).

At any time you roll for *Force Use*, you can increase the result you get by one up in the ladder, if you let *The Dark Side Tempt You*.

THE DARK SIDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Characters have a “Dark Side” level or state, as follows:

#. **None** – The Force flows freely within you. You act with compassion and clarity.
#. **Tempted** – You’ve glimpsed the power of anger or fear; it whispers when you’re vulnerable.
#. **Struggling** – The Dark Side tugs at your emotions. You justify harsh or selfish choices.
#. **Corrupted** – Darkness clouds your judgment. The Force bends easily to your rage and desire.
#. **Bound** – You serve the Dark Side willingly, twisting its power to your own ends—or so you think.
#. **Consumed** – Fully claimed by the Dark Side. You are its vessel—your character becomes an NPC.

Whenever **The Dark Side Tempts You**, roll 1d6 (the lower the better) and compare with your current Dark Side level. If you get a result lower than what you currently have, you maintain it. If you get a result equal or higher, you increase it by one.

At GM’s discretion, If the “evil deed” is a mild one, roll 2d6 and keep the lowest result. If, on the contrary, the deed is a terrible one, roll 2d6 and keep the highest [#]_.

.. [#] Examples of mild “evil deeds” could be: lying to someone for personal gain; stealing a small item; hurting someone verbally or emotionally; abandoning an ally in need; using Force powers for selfish reasons; etc. Examples of terrible “evil deeds” could be: killing someone intentionally; torturing or maiming someone; betraying a close ally; committing atrocities against innocents; using Force powers to harm or kill others; etc. If the GM considers the deed to be pure evil, they can even decide to increase that character's Dark Side level automatically, without rolling.

Using the Force and tapping the Dark Side is one of the ways in which *The Dark Side Tempts You*.
But doing any action that would be considered “evil” (at GM’s discretion) will also trigger a Dark Side temptation roll.

REDEMPTION AND ATONEMENT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a player declares that they're putting their character on a path of redemption, the GM should take note of every good deed or selfless sacrifice they do. After a while (or after a considerable good deed) they can decrease one level in their Dark Side state. If they continue doing good deeds, they can decrease even more, but one at a time (it is slower to redeem yourself than to fall back again!). Also, a character that falls back too deep into the Dark Side again should not be allowed to be redeemed as easily as before. It is increasingly harder to come back from the Dark Side. 

It is possible for Force Users to dabble and flirt with the dark side but not be completely **Consumed** by it. It is not easy, but it can be done. They are called *Gray Jedi* or *Gray Force Users*.
