Dark Magic
==========

.. _dark-magic:

Magic is an esoteric art that is very dangerous even in the best case scenarios. It takes its energy from the life essence of everything around the caster. A magic-user knows how to tap just enough, to power their spells in a somewhat safe way.

Spells
~~~~~~

.. compound::
   
   Spells must be tattooed on the caster's body and recited at the time of execution. To create a Spell, generate a formula with a d6: 1-2: **Effect + Element**, 3-4: **Element + Form**, 5-6: **Effect + Form**. Then define it with the following tables, extrapolating function from its name.
   
   Roll d12 to generate the **Effect**.

In a Dark Fantasy setting, magic is often weird, corrupting, unpredictable, or a combination of all of those.

Use the :hoverxref:`Creative Magic <creative-magic>` system, but with the following changes:

- **Subtle magic** is the only "safe" way to cast spells, but the effects are always limited or of low impact.
- **Overt Magic** always "defiles" a small area around the caster, regardless of any *Condition* or *Magical Mishap* caused by the result of the dice roll.
- **Massive Magic** always "defiles" a very large area around the caster, regardless of any *Condition* or *Magical Mishap* caused by the result of the dice roll.


.. admonition:: Defiling Magic

  Defiling Magic is a consequence of using Overt or Massive Magic. When a spell defiles an area, it leaves a mark on the environment, corrupting it and making it inhospitable to life. This can manifest in various ways, such as:

  - Blighted landscapes, where nothing grows
  - Mutated creatures, twisted by the residual magic
  - Haunting echoes of the spell's power, lingering in the air

  Characters should be aware of the potential consequences of their magic use and consider the long-term effects on the world around them. Those that Defile without care are considered evil by most communities.
