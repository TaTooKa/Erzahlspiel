Skills
------

To create a character, the player must choose 5 **General** skills, 4 **Specialization** skills, and 3 **Mastery** skills. Keep in mind that many skills have a prerequisite (other skills with arrows that point to them).

General/Specialization/Mastery Skill tiers work in a similar way to :hoverxref:`Descriptor Tiers <descriptor-tiers>`.
