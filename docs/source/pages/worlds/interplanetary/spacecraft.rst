COMBAT

TODO

Combat should be based on roleplaying decisions more than wargamey mechanics.
Decide between evade/pursue/outrun/maintain course/destroy vessel/incapacitate vessel, etc
Destroying a ship is easy, but mostly useless to both sides. Surrender is most common.
Negotiations after surrender include jettisoning or transferring cargo/fuel/money.

SPACECRAFT LIST
---------------

These are the basic stats for the most common types of spacecraft found in the solar system.
Note that these are factory-defaults for different classes of vessels; Many manufacturers can
change the specifics, and custom modifications are also commonplace. For example, it is very
common for long-range transit vessels to house Centrifuge Rings with rotating habitat
compartments, to avoid the need of constant thrust to generate artificial gravity (although this
usually increases price and maintenance costs considerably).

LIGHT FREIGHTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These relatively small craft are built to transport cargo between small distances (inside or
between close planetary systems). They are not capable of sustained high-G burns, which is
why they *flip-n-burn* at low Gs or do partial brachistochrone transfers with prolonged 0G
drifts.
