Crafter Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Exalted Mark
***************

Your mark has been added to the roll of honor in your local
town. This was likely a political decision, as you’d only just
passed from apprenticeship to tradesman. You were quite
naive when you were invested, but now that you’ve had
time to ponder the matter, you think you know who was
behind it. Who are they, what motives did they have, and
do you deserve to be among the invested?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

2. Gifted Mark
**************

Your mark is that of your grandfather: a mark proudly
passed on to all his apprentices to show that they conform
to the family tradition. There is a problem, though. Having
witnessed the many wondrous designs and creations of
your kin, you suspect you are unworthy to use the mark.
It started before the old man died, when he criticized
your work, and his stern words became a shadow in the
back of your mind. What was his criticism, and do you
still use the mark?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Craft`` *skill*.

3. The Quiet Hours of Peace
***************************

Your apprenticeship fell in a lull between wars between
neighboring powers. Though you still had hours of drudgery
in which to learn your trade, making weapons was low on
the list of priorities. You had to work such craftsmanship
out for yourself. Your first self-made blade was balanced
poorly and its edge was fragile, but you needed it and you
were unwilling to steal a blade. Why did you need the blade,
and did it serve its purpose?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Battle`` *skill*.

4. Pressed for War
******************

Your apprenticeship came to you as siege engines fired
over the bulwarks of your city and shattered the walls and
roofs within. The blacksmiths made weapons and armor
constantly, and often enough you were handed a box of
scrap metal and told “get to it”. After ten days, you’d done
more work than most journeymen and produced some
quality work, despite the pressures outside. What was
your greatest creation from that time? What came of it?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Craft`` *skill*.

5. Too Many Closed Mines
************************

You passed your apprenticeship, but only barely so. Ore was
rare and mines were largely worked out. You had to scavenge
with some of your fellow apprentices to try and find enough
ore to work with. When you finally found some, a gang or
prospectors tried to steal it from you. What happened? Did
you get enough metal to achieve the journeyman rank, or
did you have to look elsewhere?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Foraging`` *skill*.

6. Sundered Mark
****************

You have caused dire offense to the guild of your home
town, and now your family’s mark has been stricken from
memory. Where it once hung, the mark has been scraped
clean, filled in, and painted over. Very few examples of
your craft remain, and folk will only buy your wares at
a significant discount. While you can still earn your way
performing your craft, it is only because of what few friends
will still stand by you. How did you earn the ire of the guild,
and who can you still count on?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Persuasion`` *skill*.

.. _serfslave-stories:

Escaped Serf/Slave Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. A Band of Brothers, Living Free
**********************************

Whether by your own hand or the will of another, you were
freed, alone in the world. You found others like yourself,
and formed a band. Through scavenging, work, and even
theft, you supported one another, hidden within a ruined
building on the fringe of society. Then something brought it
to an end. Who betrayed your band? What, or who, were the
guards looking for? Why do your former friends mistrust you?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

2. Hidden Far from Noble Sight
******************************

Suddenly they died and you were alone. You could go
anywhere, do anything. You took their money and spent
every penny, constantly on the move. Then you found it: a
perfect home, far from suspicious eyes. That home is gone
now, just a memory that makes you smile. Where was that
home, and what made it so special?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Travel`` *skill*.

3. One of the Multitudes
************************

Thousands of laborers toiled in the site as your master
brought forth his vision. Conditions were cruel and many
times you tasted the lash. As if by a miracle, the call came.
As the uprising spread through the camp, with dozens of
others you won your escape. Did you fight your oppressors
valiantly, or did you slink away like a cur?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Athletics`` *skill*.

4. Under the Eyes of the Masters
********************************

They know you have escaped and they know where you
have run. Perhaps they bide their time, or perhaps you are
not worth the cost of retrieval. Still you know the strange
one from the blackened tower has spies that watch your
every step. Why is the strange one so interested in you?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hiding`` *skill*.

5. Hunted by Your Master
************************

Your former master never forgot the indignity of your
escape. Now with estate in ruins, she lives only for vengeance. Who is she and why does she hate you so much?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Intimidation`` *skill*.

6. Hunted by the Law
********************

They’re on your track, crashing through taverns and looking
in the alleys. Perhaps you committed the crime and it was
worth it. Perhaps you are unjustly tormented. Either way, a
trail of suffering follows in your wake. Whose suffering do
you regret the most and what will you do to put them at ease?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Persuasion`` *skill*.

.. _farmer-stories:

Farmer Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Blessed Harvests
*******************

You remember fondly how hard work made the ground
spill its bounty and how the seasons seemed to be fair.
You remember the fellowship of your loved ones. Where
are they now?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Foraging`` *skill*.

2. Ample for Winter
*******************

Every day brought a small hardship that made you strong.
The ground was hard in summer and slush in winter, yet
when the stores had to be opened there was always enough
barley for a strong drink and plenty of food. Looking back,
you scarcely remember the people of your village. Should
you return, they would scarce remember you. Perhaps
there is someone there worth returning to see. Do you even
remember that person’s name?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Athletics`` *skill*.

3. Winter in the Balance
************************

It was a struggle every year. The lord took plenty for his
knights, leaving little for the common folk. Sometimes
you ate, while other times you simply drank snow water
and slept as the wolves howled. You remember no beauty
in that bleak place — only the torments of the thieving
knights. One knight in particular took pleasure in the
hardship he inflicted. If you meet him again, will you
take revenge? Why?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hiding`` *skill*.

4. Meager Soup and Angry Eyes
*****************************

Even the protectors of your village went hungry, and when
they did, everyone suffered. Raids were planned on other
villages, but you never saw any of the food they brought
back. The only way to survive was by poaching, but the
game was scarce and you had to keep your kills to yourself.
Eventually, you were found out and the angry eyes of the
villagers were terrible to behold. Were you punished, and
did you ever redeem yourself?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hunting`` *skill*.

5. Not a Spare Bean
*******************

You remember seeing the warrior die. He simply stopped
and fell, his armor clattering on the stony ground. He had
come to take taxes for the fifth time, but there was no food
or other wealth to be had. When he learned he could take
nothing from you and your kin, he just stopped, as if his soul
had given up, onwards to some other place of plenitude.
The horse was short work for the butcher and you were
sent south to find someone to buy the man’s sword. Did
you find a buyer? Did you take the profits home?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Persuasion`` *skill*.

6. Famine
*********

When the crops were gone, you ate the beasts of the forest.
Then you killed and shared the beasts that worked your fields.
As water became a luxury, some in your village looked at the
soft flesh of the masters and contemplated a different type
of prey. As the knife sunk deep into the landowner’s agent,
rain began to fall. You looked on in horror, as desperation
revealed its ugliest side. You were forced to ask yourself the
hardest question. How hungry were you?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

.. _herder-stories:

Herder Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. A Heavy Lambing Season
*************************

You scarcely remember the work, but you’ll never forget
the noise. An endless chorus of bleats, swearing, and the
wet sounds of butchery. When the season was over, you
were rich enough to afford comforts your forebears had
never indulged in. What did you get a taste for, and does
it tempt you still?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Performance`` *skill*.

2. Nights of Sweet Silence
**************************

You remember the hills where you rested, sandwiched
between the grasses and scented herbs of the wild. The
days were tender and the nights were long. You spent more
time at play than at work, and gained memories that still
lighten your heart, even in leaner years. Of these, what is
your fondest memory?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Lore`` *skill*.

3. Howls in the Night
*********************

Wolves were only an occasional threat, but tell that to
your aunt. She was determined to make you a masterful
wolf hunter, even if she had to beat the lessons into you.
Despite all the training, you only remember hearing
howls once. Your aunt woke you quietly and with you
went into the forest, brandishing fire and steel. When
you emerged into daylight, she seemed a hundred years
older and you never slept properly again. What dreams
haunt you still?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hunting`` *skill*.

4. A Decimated Herd
*******************

The illness left many dead in its wake. Superstition had
its way, and even more of the herd were sacrificed to save
the healthy. When the plague had passed, only one in five
lived. The herd was doomed. Your cattle master drove the
remainder to town, where they were slaughtered and the
money divided amongst you. In the morning, you found
him hanged with a lock of his wife’s hair still woven around
his fingers. Just the night before he had seemed so wise.
What was the last thing he said to you?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Herbalism`` *skill*.

5. Wolves Amongst the Flock
***************************

It was only natural in the hard winter that the wolves would
find you. At first, they were the nuisance they had always
been, but as the snows grew deeper the tracks got larger.
Somewhere in the forest, a great wolf was gathering a pack
larger than any seen before. Foresters would go in gangs to
gather firewood, but you quickly found yourself lost. In the
snow while carrying a bundle of wet branches, you saw it
and looked into its eyes. To this day those eyes haunt you.
What did you see and why did it let you live?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Tracking`` *skill*.

6. Raiders
**********

First there was nothing but thin trails of smoke, off in the
distance. Soon there was the report of laughter, carried
as if on the wind. In hushed tones, the old men of your
village whispered a word that carried with it a weight of
dread… “Raiders!” The fences were surrounded with traps
and the able-bodied in your village were set as guards. On
the third night the raiders struck. Half the herd was stolen
and fifteen were placed upon the pyre. Finally, it was time
for the young to speak and your voice joined many. What
did you do, and what was the cost?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Battle`` *skill*.

.. _merchant-stories:

Merchant Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Extravagant Profits
**********************

There was only ever celebration in your grandfather’s
house. Granted a monopoly long ago, he sold his goods for a
handsome price, and his competitors had no recourse when
his soldiers confiscated or taxed their goods on the road to
town. You were a noble in all but name, but it did not last.
Now the old man is dead and the monopolies returned to
the prince who increases the taxation on your properties
to ruinous amounts. While he was alive, the old man had
a motto that governed all his business dealings. What was
that motto, and do you agree with it?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Persuasion`` *skill*.

2. Profits from the Town
************************

While working in your aunt’s home you got to see many
wealthy visitors stop by and broker purchases. You were
young enough that they didn’t pay you much mind unless
you were serving wine. Consequently, you learned a great
deal that the visitors didn’t want your aunt to know. A
generous woman, she always made sure you were rewarded
whenever a significant deal was brokered. What was your
biggest score, and did the customer ever find out?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hiding`` *skill*.

3. Profits from the Road
************************

It seemed like you were always on the move. Taking goods
from one town, trading them for goods in the next, pocketing some coin along the way. Spending the coin on some
cheap wine, and then moving on. It was easy to become
embittered about your cousins, living it up in the city while
you plied your way through the expanses on dangerous
caravan routes. Still, it’s not like you didn’t have adventures
or see amazing sights. What was the most amazing thing
you have ever seen?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Travel`` *skill*.

4. The Lash of Taxation
***********************

Your local lord had grandiose dreams and a mind to have
the merchants within his lands pay for them. You learned
that sometimes a merchant needs to have two cargoes: one
to be seen, and one to pay for the trip. You also witnessed
firsthand what happens to smugglers. Who did you see
suffering at the hands of the lord’s soldiers?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

5. Hard-won Profits
*******************

When you were young, a bandit lord took to plundering your family’s caravans. At first, mercenaries were
hired, but they deserted and joined the bandits in their
plunder. Then, soldiers were borrowed from the king
but the taxes on that service were exorbitant. You spoke
up and offered a plan that made half your family revile
you and the rest love you. What was your plan, and why
was it so effective?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Performance`` *skill*.

6. Ruin
*******

Your family had been making profits and living well. You
were not one of the most powerful families but you had
enough long-lasting ties that your future seemed secure.
Over the course of one banquet, all this changed. Your
uncle offended one of the more powerful courtiers, and
the courtier made it his mission to destroy your family.
By the time the courtier was done, your family’s name
was in ruin. The king granted your rivals monopolies that
blocked your goods from entry to the larger cities, and
bandits harassed your caravans. When the fire took your
family’s estate, you were left thoroughly dispossessed. Now
that you’ve started to rise, you must consider your options.
What vengeance, if any, will you take upon the courtier?
How will you escape his wrath?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Intimidation`` *skill*.

.. _outcast-stories:

Outcast Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. The Charity of Honest Men
****************************

While you might not be the most pathetic of the beggars,
in a time of need a charitable man of means gave food and
shelter enough to survive. What had enfeebled you, and
who was your benefactor?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Foraging`` *skill*.

2. The Charity of Pompous Priests
*********************************

As a display of piety, a priest took you in and read to you
boring sermons, hour after hour. While you stayed with
the priest, you saw many treasures and ate scraps that
at any other table would be the height of dining. Did
you take anything from the priest’s home, and is your
theft known?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Lore`` *skill*.

3. Food and Rough Liquor
************************

The rabble of your shanty might not have had much, but it
was shared with cheer and many fond (if humble) memories
were made. Now this shanty is no more. What befell its
inhabitants? Did any survive?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Craft`` *skill*.

4. One of the Rabble
********************

There were hundreds squabbling over food in the shadows
of the lord’s fealty. Betrayal was a part of life, but you never
expected it from your fellow outcasts. Who betrayed you,
and why do you still feel the sting of the betrayal?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

5. Shunned Even by Lepers
*************************

There was a time you were doing well for one of the ragged,
but then something happened. You barely remember how
or why it happened, but it marked you as surely as if it were
branded upon your face. Why do the beggars spit at your
shadow? Are there any that remember you with kindness?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hiding`` *skill*.

6. Hunted by the Law
********************

They’re on your track, crashing through taverns and looking
in the alleys you used to haunt. Perhaps you committed
the crime and it was worth it. Perhaps you are unjustly
persecuted. Either way, a trail of suffering follows in your
wake. Whose suffering do you regret the most and what
will you do to put them at ease?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Pickpocket`` *skill*.

.. _nobility-stories:

Petty Noble Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Guest of a Greater Name
**************************

At a young age, you piqued the attentions of one of the great
nobles within your land. Their expectations were impossible
to meet, but the training they offered you was second to
none. While much of the training was typical, some of it
was bizarre, to say the least. What strange knowledge did
this notable personage seek to impart to you?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Lore`` *skill*.

2. Guest of a Rival
*******************

You spent your childhood in the care of a political rival.
You wanted for nothing, but there was an air of constant
threat that made it hard for you to relax and thrive. One
night, you wandered the halls and witnessed three warriors
speaking in hushed tones about your host, your family’s
rival. What did you hear, and what did you do about it?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

3. Left to Your Own Devices
***************************

Your home was a dull one, where little was expected of
you. You could come and go as you saw fit. While others
in your family suffered the responsibilities of your caste,
you were free to pursue talents that a proper tutor might
have deemed unsuitable. What did you get up to when no
one was watching?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Acrobatics`` *skill*.

4. Exile to the Estates
***********************

You didn’t think it would happen, but your parents decided
that enough was enough, and sent you from the estate
and holdings you had been raised within. Banished from
civilization to miserable estates, you spent many years
impoverished, abandoned by your family. What, if anything,
did you do to provoke this banishment? Was it just? Did
you ever make amends?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Travel`` *skill*.

5. Scandal
**********

Had they caught you in time you might have escaped
with mere banishment. Instead, intervention came too
late, and you brought scandal down upon your family,
besmirching their good name to all within your sphere.
Bribes were paid, and the offense was put behind you, but
other nobles know what happened, and often speak ill of
you behind your back. What was the scandal?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Performance`` *skill*.

6. Blood Feud
*************

The insult is deep. So deep that blood may not settle the
debt it has incurred. Though the one who gave offense was
banished, theirs was merely the most egregious of the insults
and accusations heaped upon you and yours. There is only
one solution: a blood feud. It matters not whether it was
called by your enemies or your allies. The only things that
matter are who your enemies are, and who will survive?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Intimidation`` *skill*.

.. _priesthood-stories:

Priesthood Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. A Time of Feasting and Merriment
***********************************

Your time as a novice has been quite unremarkable, but for
you it’s been a time of exposure to wise sages, great scholars,
peace, and prosperity. Simply being in the presence of the
gifted has taught you many things. Primary amongst these
is that even the gifted have moments of doubt or disgrace.
You have even come to the aid of one of your land’s more
gifted artists. What aid did they require, and how did you
help? Have they repaid the favor?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Craft`` *skill*.

2. Beneficial Omens
*******************

Your birth was marked by strange omens, and your induction was conducted at a time when the stars were at their
peak. Members of your order speak about you in hushed
tones, worried about the meaning of so many omens surrounding your entry into their ranks. Occasionally, members of your order will come to you with strange tests and
tasks, seeking answers to questions they will not share with
you. What was your strangest task? Did you complete it,
and were there any notable omens during its completion?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Lore`` *skill*.

3. A Place in Need of Guidance
******************************

You rode into town with your master and two others, to bring
the teachings of your god to the disbelievers. Your arrival
was met with indifference, but over time you established a
small shrine and some of the curious became worshipers. As
offerings became more frequent, you drew the attention of
a local noble, who threatened your shrine should he not be
paid off. Your master refused to pay, and the consequences
were dire. What happened to your shrine? What happened
to the noble who set into motion its downfall?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hiding`` *skill*.

4. Intolerant Potentates
************************

You didn’t join your faith with battle in mind, but your
potentates were wrathful in the extreme and soon all your
order wore blades. Your battlefield was in the streets, and
many fell to your blade. You tried to be merciful when
you could afford it, and deep within the home of one of
your faith’s enemies, you found someone who could be
brought to your faith. Did you help this person escape,
or were you prevented somehow? What became of this
potential follower?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Battle`` *skill*.

5. Ill Omens
************

Your birth was marked by strange omens, and immediately
after your induction into the priesthood, the high priest died
in his sleep, without any prior illness. Members of your order
mutter that you are the last survivor of the ceremony, and
that ill fortune follows in your wake. Occasionally, members
of your order will come to you, sending you miles away on
seemingly needless, sometimes dangerous errands. What
was your most perilous task? Did you complete it, and how
many died during its completion?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Intimidation`` *skill*.

6. Forced Penance
*****************

Whatever offense was committed, you didn’t do it.
Somehow you were blamed, and another bore witness
against you, falsely. You tried to explain this when you were
accused, but the high priest did not care. Your penance
was brief, but unduly harsh. What were you accused of?
What was the penance? Do you know who incriminated
you? Do you plot revenge?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Deception`` *skill*.

.. _warrior-stories:

Warrior Stories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Decisive Victory
*******************

The war saw you fight in many battles, gaining glory as you
survived. Then the final clash came. You leapt to the front,
proud of your place in the vanguard. Horses cried in pain
as arrows rained down, and through the blood and smoke
of the field you saw your opportunity. The charge was long
and the fight short but when you presented your captains
with the banner you had claimed, they proclaimed you
one of the day’s chosen champions. You were cared for by
your lord’s own servants and presented to him at the feast
afterward. What valor had you accomplished? What words
did he have for you?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Lore`` *skill*.

2. Glorious Battle
******************

The battle began with your numbers few. The bulk of your
force was a day away and would be tired from the march. You
knew yourselves dead, but you had to hold out so that the
warriors would stand an even chance against the horde. The
fight was brutal. The corpses of horses, soldiers, and other
makeshift barricades piled up in front of your line, turning
the fight from massed battle to deadly skirmish. Fully half
of your number was slain, but you gave better than you got
and it was them that routed. When the rest of your army
emerged from the forest road, they found boys turned into
veterans. Your company was promoted to guard the sunrise
flank and those who survived became strong friends. How
do you mark your membership in this august company?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Hiding`` *skill*.

3. Idle Hours Guarding Open Gates
*********************************

Your gate was the main gate for your settlement. You saw
all who would come through. While there was little trouble,
you saw many strange and varied travelers. One day you
saw three riders come close to the settlement gates. They
halted, spat at the ground, and rode back the way they
came. Do you remember anything about these strangers?
Did you find out why they did not enter?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Intimidation`` *skill*.

4. Idle Hours Guarding Cold Walls
*********************************

Your home was less-than-inviting to strangers. Most were
greeted with spear points and sling stones. Soon the word
spread and few travelers made the journey. You spent
many hours drinking swill and rolling dice for petty coin.
Eventually even these pursuits grew stale and you were
forced to find your own entertainments. How did you
survive the boredom? What pursuits did you engage in?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Performance`` *skill*.

5. Blood-soaked Endeavor
************************

While the vanguard gained the glories, you were treading
the ground they swept, preventing the enemy from encirclement, stomping the injured into the mud. As the day
turned to evening and the light began to shift, the scope of
the massacre became clear. Your army had swept through
the enemy and carved deep into their encampment. The
bodies of servants and children littered the ground. Seeking
to profit from the battle, you searched the nearby tents and
left, knowing the enemy would never truly recover. What
loot did you gather and whose hand did you prize it from?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Pickpocket`` *skill*.

6. Disastrous Battle
********************

Your armies were evenly matched and the battle a stalemate ‘til the third hour, when the heavens opened with
torrential rainfall, centered upon your forces. The ground
turned to a thick black swamp and their archers, outside the
rain’s course, could fire unmolested. The wind carried their
arrows into your ranks and soon there wasn’t a soldier left
unmarked. Only a very few limped away from the battle,
and none made it home. How did you escape?

*Gain or Increase the* ``Athletics`` *skill*.

3. Educated on the Battlefield
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your education was a harsh one, your schoolyard strewn
with the dead and dying, the clash and clamor of combat
were your lessons. For whatever reason, as a child you were
thrust into battle, forced to fight for your survival with your
enemies as the strictest of taskmasters.

- Gain or Increase the ``Battle`` skill.
- Gain Equipment: A melee weapon of choice and a helmet.

4. Elder Mentor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your mentor was venerable, well-known and respected
by peers and associates, but was one whose heyday had
passed. It was time for you to pick up your belongings and
continue on your mentor’s path, continuing that great and
respected tradition.

- Gain or Increase any one :hoverxref:`skill <sword-and-sorcery-skills>` of your choice.
- Gain Equipment: Something from your mentor passed to you (your choice).

5. Family Footsteps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You learned your career directly from one of your family
members: whether a parent, grandparent, uncle or aunt,
brother or sister. This meant that you received additional
attention, but also meant that the lessons were longer and
the standards were much higher.

- Gain or Increase one of the ``Craft``, ``Foraging``, ``Taming``, or ``Hunting`` skills (your choice).
- Gain Equipment: A family heirloom of little more than sentimental value.

6. From Masterful Tutors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fortunate was your apprenticeship, and you found yourself
able to learn under the tutelage of a true master. Whether
sitting on the rough ground beside your teacher, educated in
the high halls of nobility, or in a well-appointed workshop,
you learned from the very best.

- Gain or Increase any one :hoverxref:`skill <sword-and-sorcery-skills>` of your choice.
- Gain Equipment: Letter of praise and introduction from your tutor.

7. Largely Absent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Left to fend for yourself, you had to learn on your own.
Perhaps it was through negligence or necessity, or it was
tragedy that kept you alone. The end result was the same:
hours and even days spent with little to do but study or
train, to repeat tasks until you had mastered them.

- Gain or Increase one of the ``Craft``, ``Lore``, or ``Hiding`` skills (your choice).
- Gain Equipment: None.

8. On Your Own Terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You always knew what you wanted, and sought out your
own education when it was clear it would not be offered
you. Driven, you chose your teachers carefully, and
found other means of learning when there were none
to instruct you. Even now, you follow your own path to
enlightenment.

- Gain or Increase one of the ``Deception``, ``Performance``, or ``Persuasion`` skills (your choice).
- Gain Equipment: None.

9. Traditional
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yours was an unremarkable education, perhaps thankfully.
You were either trained in the family trade, apprenticed to
a (mostly) benevolent master, or tutored without overmuch
drama. As such, your education was well-rounded, if not
the most inspired. Looking back, you feel blessed.

- Gain or Increase any one :hoverxref:`skill <sword-and-sorcery-skills>` of your choice.
- Gain Equipment: Choose one of the following: heavy cape, crafting tools, or a melee weapon.

10. Under Duress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether you were enslaved, apprenticed cruelly, or were
simply a reluctant student, your education was a hard-fought
battle that you stubbornly resisted, only learning when it
became absolutely necessary (and sometimes even barely
so). Others look to these years with fondness: you do not.

- Gain or Increase one of the ``Acrobatics``, ``Hiding``, ``Lockpicking``, or ``Pickpocket`` skills (your choice).
- Gain Equipment: A memento of someone that is long gone.
